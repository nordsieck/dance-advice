4 way of teaching:
1. Rhythmic/pattern
2. Connection
3. Music
4. Quality of movement

* Experiment with repeating a movement for "too long".  Way too long.
* When teaching multiple methods of learning, having them dovetail together is fantastic.

Learn to listen to people.  "I like to watch the teacher first and then do movements"
really means "I get distracted easily and can't pay attention to the Teacher when
other people are doing things or I am dancing".
