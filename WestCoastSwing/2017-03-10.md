* There are some times, especially when I'm dancing with more advanced dancers
  that I don't move back on one.
* For the most part the only way I can express musicality is to alter the
  partnership via the connection.  I am long overdue for a lot of solo dance
  practice so that I can express my musicality in my own body without affecting
  the partnership.
* I am sometimes ambiguous about my sugar tucks vs rolls.  I need to be careful
  about keeping sugar tucks around the shoulder and eliminating the prep from
  sugar rolls.
* There are a lot of places in the music where I want to do a back-and-forth
  movement.  I think that it suits the west coast aestetic to instead keep
  moving forward and maybe do repeated walking or something similar.
