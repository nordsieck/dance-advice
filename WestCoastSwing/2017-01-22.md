Josh and Delancey

* Beginning follows depend on flight (movement).  It is hard
  for them to dance in place.
* Follows in close position:
  * Turn to face the connection arm slight.  This will make your
    back easier to hold onto.
  * When rotating, make sure to turn your head faster than your
    elbow.  This will prevent you elbowing your lead in the face.
  * When rotating, don't try to bring the arm/elbow up.  Try to
    just slip the elbow over the lead's arm.
* Leads:
  * In closed position, don't use your finger tips much (at all).
    Connection should be in the palm and lower fingers.
  * Fingers indicate the direction of the turn.  This is not
    necessary, but is nice.
* Keep your shoulders back - don't collapse frame under pressure.
  If the pressure gets too great, move your feet.
