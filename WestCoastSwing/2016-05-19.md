Hareesh and Angela

* Start collecting for 5 of the whip on 4-and.  On 5, open
the hip to rotate and make sure that you change weight to
the forward foot.  Being split weight here is a big problem.
* In general, think of smoothing transitions.
* Turns are set at the beginning.  If you want to accelerate
or decelerate you have to do it during the prep.
* 4 hand heights: neutral, turn prep, turn and low turn (fold).
* Roll: prep inside then prep high and outside.  Should feel
like a free spin.
* If you want to do a continuous turn, make sure to keep your
hand up at turn height.
* Lead from the hip.  You have a tendency to "cheat" and body
lead with the shoulders.  Make sure that your whole body is
integrated.
* When ending a turn, lower your hand a 1/2 turn before the
end - don't be too early!

* Same side whip: need to step forward on 4 to redirect.
* Reverse whip: start with cross-hand lead.
* Can combine whips.
* If the follow isn't getting around in time, lead more
translational or rotational energy.  Also can extend
arm straight out at the end of the turn to accelerate it a
bit.  Called "follow through".
