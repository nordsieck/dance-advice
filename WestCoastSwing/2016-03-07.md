* Never travel up the slot - always down.
* The impetus of "backwards" movement in the basket whip
  is the same as in the normal whip.  The follow reaches
  the end of her possible movement and has to reverse
  direction.  There is not step backwards.
* You can tell swung music because triple steps will feel
  natural.  You can simulate this feeling in non-swung
  music by emphasizing the up beat.
