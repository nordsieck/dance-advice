* Make sure to create directional momentum at the beginning of the movement.
* Rock steps involve both translational energy and rotational energy.
* You need stretch going into the rock step.
* For the sugar tuck into rock step:
  1. Slow the directional momentum to build stretch and prevent settling on 4.
  2. Check forward on 5 - project a bit.
  3. Settle back on and.
  4. Step out of the slot on 6.
* Cross hand sugar push
  * Make sure that the follow's arm is in the proper position (straight-ish).
    Your arm may be sideways because of this if you are both in slot.
  * An alternate option is to use a sort of yale position (off set from the slot).
    As a side note, the follow should not try to normalize (like with a tuck) the
    slot.  This will allow for a more natural straight-ish arm for both roles.
* Double turn behind the back
  * Lead straight down the slot, but step to the left out of the slot.  This is
    easier if you are offset from the slot.
  * J-hook to lead the turn.  Do not look at the follow - must be done by feel.
    The hand must be at turn height (not pre-turn) because you won't know when
    to raise it to the proper height.
  * Keep hand and wrist loose.
  * To hand change, raise the other hand up, lower than the first.  Keep it flat
    and allow the follow to run into / fall onto the second hand.
  * Curve the fingers at the last 1/2 rotation so you have something to anchor
    with.
  * Make sure to post.
