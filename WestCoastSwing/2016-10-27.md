Hareesh and Angela

* Don't let your arms reach full extension.
* Get out of the slot as little as you need to.  Being close makes
  everything easier.
* Start paying attention to what your follow is doing across moves so
  you can compensate before the problem arises.
* Don't allow the tuck pass to reach compression - it is a barely
  glancing blow.
* On an inside roll, don't present your elbow to the follow - that's
  a chance for injury.  Instead, present the inside of your elbow.
* Small preps are good, but you do have to cross neutral to prep again.
* Never come back up the slot.
* Don't accelerate in the 5 of the whip.  Just take your follow
  with you firmly.
