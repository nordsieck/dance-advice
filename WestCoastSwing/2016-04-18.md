* In the reverse whip or any other move that starts as a pass or turn,
  you may need to j-hook to get the proper orientation from your follow,
  e.g. do you want them to be square or angled to the slot?
* Take the full 4th count in a whip.  Don't rotate early.
* The 5th count of a whip is like a door opening.  Don't drive forward
  with your right shoulder.
* Reverse directions of a sugar push on "and-uh" of 2.  3 should be a
  step forward.
* You can insert even numbers of beats any time there is a direction
  change.
* When changing weight, use head vs hip weight depending on mechanics
  (how fast you need to move) and how it looks.
* The follow can be mid-turn at the post.  Only move post to keep
  connection (if the follow takes abnormally sized steps).
* With more advanced follows, you can use your body to stop in the middle
  of a pattern.  A more sure way to stop a follow is to put up your hand,
  like you're going to initiate a turn.
