* Never be in neutral.
* Music drill: play music and have it cut in and out unexpectedly.
  Most modern music is computer modified to be exactly on time,
  so this usually works.
* "No anchor" drill: dance without the anchor.  Forces you to
  change and absorb weight more quickly than you'd normally do it.
* Opposition at all times: if someone is close compress them out.
* Variety in basics is super important (timing, shape, etc.)
* Don't comprimise your good technique for someone else's bad
  technique.  If your lead leads your early, wait delay your own
  steps so you are on time.  This isn't a hijack - you are
  following what's being lead, just not on the time it's being
  lead.

Ben and Cameo

* When dancing in neutral connection is via momentum.
* Use lots of surface area when connecting.  Make sure to
  connect to the opposite side of the body when redirecting.
* Heaviness is driven by partner shared weight.
