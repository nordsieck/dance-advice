* Step directly away from the follow on 1.
* The slot is to be shared by both the lead and follow.  During a pass, the
  slot can be shared if the lead and follow are both sideways during the
  pass.
* Before starting to move, establish a connection.   This typically involves
  dancing a bit in close position, or increasing the tension in the connection
  before moving.  Othewise, the follow will be surprised and feel a tug.
* Arms are level-ish (depending on the heights of the partners) and on tracks.
  Arms only slide forward and backward on the tracks.  If you have to take them
  off the tracks to move further, you're trying to go too far.  "Take the cookies
  out of the oven and put them back in the over".
* Turn your head (and body) early during a pass.
