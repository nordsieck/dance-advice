Hareesh and Angela

* When walking, legs are never both straight.  The trailing leg
  breaks to drive before the other foot gets weight.
* Body leads movement.  Feet support the body.
* Arms wide and parallel to the slot.
* Left side pass:
  * Look down the slot, not at your partner.
  * Pass close - 3 to 6 inches.  Do this by taking in the arms all
    the way and widening the connection.  Make sure to lead with
    your frame.
  * Anchor.  This can be a tiny pull.
* Whip:
  * J hook on 2.  Lead the follow's orientation to the slot.
  * Transition during the catch to 90% tension in the right hand.
    Make sure to keep connection with the left hand.
  * 4 should be small and parallel (not forward!).  Feet should
    be interleaved.
