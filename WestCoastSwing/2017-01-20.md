* On 4 land on the heel and roll through the foot for the rest
  of the beat to absorb momentum.
* On 6, delay placing the foot down completely until "and uh"
  to increase connection.
* On 6, use "open 3rd" foot position.  This puts your weight over
  the correct foot and allows your heels to pass each other.

Chris and Tara

* Be open to modifying basics e.g. with angles.
* The principle of opposition.  It applies to more things than
  you think.
* Be open to improv - "say yes".
* When over rotated, keep arm under boobs (wenis weight).
