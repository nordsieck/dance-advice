Drills:

Isolations.  Head, Shoulders, Ribcage, Hips, Knees, Feet.
Move Forward, Back, Left, Right, Back, Forward, Right, Left.
Do at 1/2 time, Single time and Double time.

Sweet 16.  Partners take turns dancing a repeating movement
for 16 beats.  Other partner mirrors the movement.  Focus is
on creativity and clarity of expression.

Dancing fast to slow.  Start at 60 bmp and increment the beat
downward every so often so that you are progressively dancing
to slower and slower music.  The feet stop moving on the beat.
You can continue to shift weight to the stopped foot, but it
must stop moving.

Circle of 8.  Triples in each of the 8 directions.  This can be
done stationary (Move in beats 1 and 2) (make sure to transfer
weight forward and back instead of doing check steps) and
traveling (Move on beat 3).  Start at quarter time, move to
half time and finish at full time.

Turn practice.  Start with feet flat.  Raise to the balls of
the feet, hold for a while and then back down.  Then raise
one foot and bring the other above the ankle.  Then raise one
foot and bring the other above the knee.
