* Constant rotation - move to 45 degrees on 2 and 1/8th rotation every beat
  after that.
* Shift weight on the anchor triple on the first beat.  Use body isolations
  to imply a triple for the rest of the counts.  This is especially good with
  slow music.  Add back in more steps (to help with driving) for faster music.
* Sugar push variation: doing collection on 2.  Tap on 3 and shift weight
  forward on 4.  Can do the lazy anchor on 5 & 6 for dat efficiency.
