Hareesh and Angela

* Bring the hand around more with coming out of a slingshot, if you want the
  follow to end square to the slot (instead of under-rotating).  This shouldn't
  be necessary, but can help get follows to understand that I want them to
  come around all the way.
* When going to half-time, it's easier on the follow if you prep by doing half-
  time on the anchor.  Overall, it's very difficult to go in and out of half-time.
  It's much easier to exit than enter.

Dip:
* Do this from slingshot or other two-handed position.
* Be sideways to the slot.
* This can be done split weight, or you can do the weight-shifts.  In either case,
  be down for stability.
* Bring the follow across your body, down the slot, and then redirect with the left
  hand, bringing her around.  Bring that hand down towards the "window" under your
  right arm.
* At the same time, sink a bit.  This is the signal to her to go under.
* As she's going down, raise the right arm to ask her to support her own weight.
  If you keep your arm down, you're asking to support her weight.
* Ideally, she'll grab your shoulder with her free hand.  Bail if she doesn't grab
  anything, or if she grabs your arm too far from the shoulder.
