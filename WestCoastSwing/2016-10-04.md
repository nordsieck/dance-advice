Hareesh and Angela

* When doing slingshot, don't stop at full extension.
* Try to stop the follow before she's settled, so that you can
  do a pseudo rock-n-go.
* Exit the slingshot by releasing your hand towards the follow
  while moving your body down slot.
* When stopping or absorbing, make sure to catch in the middle of
  the body by weight - differs from person to person.
* Make your movements smaller
