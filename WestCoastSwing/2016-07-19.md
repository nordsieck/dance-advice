Hareesh and Angela

* A sugar roll comes in closer than a sugar tuck.  You can add
the off hand to help differentiate it from a tuck turn.
* Think about leading up during the rotation (to keep her in place)
and away at the end when using the off hand and ending in closed.
* The easiest way out of closed after the roll is a rock-and-go.
Feel which foot she is on and move accordingly.  Also you can let
her settle or rock-and-go immediately.
* In general use leverage or stretch to modify timing instead of
height.
* Height is for tightening or expanding patterns.
* West coast aestetic: slotty and one leg is straight, one leg is
bent.  Function drives form.
* Small preps.  If the follow doesn't have frame lead bigger
translation to strengthen the connection.
