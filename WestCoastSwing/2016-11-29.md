* Ideas around better leading of a half-time sugar tuck:
  * Make sure to absorb, compress and redirect with the body.
  * Absorb at half-time - don't try to slow at the re-direct.
* Cross hand sugar tuck: left, right, right, neutral panneling.
* In order to step forward, drive with the weighted leg.  This
  requires that you are on the ball of your weighted foot and
  perfectly balanced.  Placement here is critical - particularly
  side-to-side placement; don't try to adjust if you are off.
  You can check to see if your placement is good by doing
  a ronde or a "spaceship" where you straighten your weighted
  leg.  Driving forward will let you move forward with the
  whole body as one unit instead of leading with the head.
* Drill: Chasse (shuffle).  Walk, walk, chasse, chasse,
  walk, collect.  During the chasse, keep the leg bent and
  weight on the ball of the foot.  Focus on driving forward
  with the leg, but also keeping the shoulders and head
  perfectly level and the body moving foward together as
  one unit.
