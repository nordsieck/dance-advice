* Grounded directional intent: done with the rolling action of your foot.
  Instead of rolling the foot neutrally, roll it with force down and at
  an angle so that the rolling action of the foot moves you back.  Doesn't
  work forward.  I think that the difference between this and driving is
  that driving is done with the leg, and rolling is done with the ankle
  and foot.
* Posture: butt over heels, shoulders over rear ball of foot.  Tail bone
  should be the rear-most part of your body (only part touching if you are
  against a wall).
* Dance with a heavy tail.  Imagine a tail sticking out from your butt and
  dance with it.
* Dance low - dance from your hips (or groin).  Move your energy low in
  your body.
* Triple drill: Done with alternating feet.
