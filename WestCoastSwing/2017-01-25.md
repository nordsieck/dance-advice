Hareesh and Angela

* Sugar Roll doesn't have preps.  Back on 1 and immediately cut to the
  right (smoothly).  Can be good to help the follow around even ending
  in open.
* If someone comes forward on 6-and, this is emergency mode.  Don't
  throw them under the bus the first time.  Instead, the goal is to
  make sure that their anchor is on time.  This usually means extra
  absorbtion to slow down the timing of the pattern.  If they come
  forward early multiple times, start floating your anchor often
  so they don't have time to come forward early.
* If you've got problems knocking knees, stop rolling through the foot
  so much during those counts of the patterns.  Keep track of when
  this is happening.
