Hareesh and Angela

* Keep your wrist still.  Don't rhythm or counting transmit
  to your partner.
* If your partner has an active wrist, don't enable it - keep
  your own quiet.
* Be able to walk through all of the standard patterns, and any
  patterns you want to be able to do well.
* Drag walks - the person "pulling" needs to be going "faster".
  If the lead is leading, take bigger steps to keep the tension.
  If the follow is leading, take smaller steps to keep the tension.
  To initiate, take a baby step.  This may or may not help.
* Half time.  Really good for slow songs.  Don't try to change
  tempo if the follow is leading drag walks.
