Hareesh and Angela

* Lead "out" (leverage), not "up" to pause.  Up has a very specific purpose
  and this isn't it.
* Don't let your left elbow come back or out too much.  Once your hand/arm
  comes back a certain distance, think of your arm as locked in position -
  you need to do something else (shape your body, move your feet, etc.) to
  accomplish the goal you are trying to accomplish with your arm.
* Make your j-hooks clear and deliberate.  Especially the on a reverse whip.
* Don't check step 3-and of a whip.  Just rotate with your feet under you.
  This will let your use your follow's momentum to carry you around.
* On a reverse whip, step with your follow on 3 so you aren't extended if
  your follow doesn't stop immediately.
