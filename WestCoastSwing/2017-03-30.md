Doug and Nicki Silton

Double resistance: partners moving in opposite directions.  This is a technique for
leading more acceleration than we otherwise would be able to.

Hitch ball change:  Lead double resistance while putting one unweighted foot down.
Then, step back for 1 and 2.  To practice this, you can lead alternating compression
and tension.

Slingshot: Lead a slingshot, and then lead compression and tension from the slingshot
position.  Exit as a whip.

Side move: First, lunge to the right.  Then the movement starts: swivel to the left on
the right foot.  Then ball change from left to right, moving the partnership to the
right one step.
