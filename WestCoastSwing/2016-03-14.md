* The lock whip or basket whip is a whip variation, where you
  start holding both of the follow's hands.  Instead of catching her
  back, you "catch" her with her arms.  Just like in a regular whip, on
  3 1/2, she is moving "forwards" and you are moving back, creating a
  stretch.  Make sure to get out of the way on 4, so she can move
  straight backwards.
* The continuous whip starts out as a regular whip, and is a 2 beat
  segment you can insert into any whip.  On 5, you pivot in place
  and you turn her around your right foot.  On 6, you cross the slot
  identically to the 4th count of a regular whip.  On the 5, it is
  important that you stop her momentum by leading a weight share.
  This is typically done by pushing the hips back.
