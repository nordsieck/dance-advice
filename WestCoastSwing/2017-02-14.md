Hareesh and Angela

* When rolling through the foot, don't take the ball of the foot
  off the floor ever (except when stepping forward).
* Pay attention to your foot movement relative to your and your
  partner's center point of balance.  When moving linearly, they
  should move at the same rate.  Pay particular attention to the
  1 of all patterns and the 5 of the whip.
* When weird stuff goes down restart slot momentum or get into
  closed position.
* If your partner is off in their own world, it's not always safe
  to lead slot momentum.  A safer option is to maintain connection
  and walk into their space (possibly close enough to pick them
  up into closed).
* Try to maintain the slot in the face of cross slot movement.
  Diagnal movement is **really** bad.  When this happens, try an
  offset lead, realigning during the pattern versus just moving
  over to be offset to her.  Also, get clarification here next
  time.
