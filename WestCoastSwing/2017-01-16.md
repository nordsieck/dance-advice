Hareesh

* Small preps.
* Make your movements, including preps smooth.  Movements should
  flow into each other.  There shouldn't be discrete stops for
  each movement.
* Make sure to rotate on the 2 of the whip.  Move than 45 degrees
  and not more than 90 degrees.
* Use your left hand in the beginning of the whip to ensure that
  the follow doesn't go too far down the slot.
