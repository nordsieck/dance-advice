* In a pass, doing step in the opposite direction to your follow (unless you want to end the pattern early).  In general you should step out of the slot on a 45 degree angle with your follow.  You can step out of the slot at a 90 degree angle if you want to make the pattern short.
* Arms high and in (collected), not down.
* In a left side pass, keep your frame.  You should rotate with your follow.  Your rotation + your frame tells your follow when and how fast to rotate.  That, along with how collected your arm is, will dictate where your follow will step - down the slot or around the slot.
* In a left side pass, the "3 and" are both collections.  4 is forward a bit and into the slot.
* Small steps.  1 foot width between your front heel and rear toe.  This will help with complaints about posting on 4.
* In a pass, don't look at the follow, use the connection to judge where she is and look down slot.  Looking can be a sign to the follow that you want to do something or alter the timing.  Also, looking down slot means turning earlier.
* In a whip, step back, open and back, and then across the slot.  On 5, drive with your right shoulder and then forward to post on 6.  This way you don't have to pull the follow with the hand on her back.
* It helps to be slightly around on 4.  You don't have to be totally around on the 5.
