Hareesh and Angela

* Make sure you don't stall the follow's progression down the slot by letting
  your hand slow slot-ward velocity.
* 0 rotation on count 1, get to 45 degrees at count 2.  Among other things,
  this is to help clear the slot.
* Some follows hang back, some drive.  Be prepared to deal with the extremes.
  Don't always accelerate.
* Halftime triples are very difficult.  Not a good idea in comps.
* During passes, make sure to bring the connection point straight down
  the slot.  Change sides after the follow has passed you.
