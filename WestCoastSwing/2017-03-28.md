Kick ball change syncopation: Replaces the 1 and 2 of any pattern.  The timing is:
    1.   kick while leading double resistance
    and. collect
    uh.  step under you (this will be about a step back from where you started)
    2.   step

Hitch ball change syncopation: same has kick, with minor differences
* Bend right knee while doing hitch (placing foot without weight).  Start
  the bend the beat before and end it the beat after, smoothly increasing and
  decreasing height.
* If you plan on doing a bunch of syncopations, it is ok to stay down with bent
  knees for a while.

For both patterns, start by leading tension (double resistance).  This is necessary
because you're compressing 2 steps into 1 1/3 steps, so the follow needs to really
accelerate.
