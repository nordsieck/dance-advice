Hareesh and Angela

* In the hand hold, use few enough fingers that the other person can hook around your fingers
* In sugar pushes:
  * The amount of tension that you feel at the beginning should be the same as the amount of compression you feel in the middle and the tension you feel on 4 of a sugar push.
  * Sugar pushes should move you back - you take 2 steps backwards and 1 step forwards, of equal size.
* Move with your head first.  This will help to ensure that your body is stacked on top of itself.
* Absorb compression all at once, don't try to do it slowly.
* The difference between "bicep curling" arm tension and doing it right is that the forearms and wrists are loose.
* Post on 4.  This is a hard stop.  For real.  Stake in the ground.

* Between the 4 & 5 in a whip, you turn the follow 180 degrees around.
* Use spotlighting to help direct the follow.
* Make sure you are parallel to the slow when the follow is passing you.
