* All turns or redirections should happen as close to the lead as
possible.  This usually means in the middle of a pass.
* Don't let your arms fully extend.
* It's ok to panel your right side with impunity.  Panneling your
left side is limited by how far your want your follower to travel.
* Leading acceleration in your movements means that you should
take smaller steps.
* The correct level to keep your hands at is the one that allows
the follow to keep her arms level.
* During compression, never compress into the hand if the wrist
is bent.  Either compress into a fist with a straight wrist, or
compress directly into the lower palm with your fingers.
* Stepping back is a good default for the 2 of the whip.  Crossing
can be useful if you want to keep the whip small, e.g. during
fast music.
* There are many opinions on most of the fundamentals.  It's a
good idea to learn how to dance with all of the most common ones.
Especially the why.
* Good timing means stopping and starting movement precisely on
time.  Movements don't need to be sharp or jerky, just crisp.
