* Start on the 1.  Some songs have a really strong upbeat, so this can be a little confusing.
* You may feel like you can only access your dance ability (musicality, etc.) or your west coast
  swing fundamentals, but not both at the same time.  Let the west coast swing fundamentals
  bridge the gap to your dance ability, not the other way around.
