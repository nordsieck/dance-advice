* A tuck turn is what happens when you interupt a turn with a redirection the other way.  You can do a basic tuck turn in one of three ways:
  1. Two hands:
    1. Straight back.
    2. Move out of the slot to the right.  "Pinch" the right armpit (rotate slightly right) to lead a small prep towards the opposite side of the slot.
    3. Lead a compression: rotate left.
    4-6. ...
  2. Left hand: Just like the two hand verison, but you need more body shaping.
  3. Right hand:
    1. Straight back.
    2. Move out of the slot to the right.  Rotate to the left as a prep.
    3. Rotate to the right.  Don't let the follow rotate towards you more than face to face.  The compression is towards the start of the slot.
    4. Step towards the end of the slot and rotate your follow with you (like a barrel roll).  This part is a free spin.
    5-6. Anchor.
