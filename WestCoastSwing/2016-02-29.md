* When doing a whip, focus on turning yourself, not turing the other person.
* There are two ways to do the first part of the whip:
  * Straight back with a j-hook to the outside
  * Straight back with an inside turn (faster than normal).  Very important
    to catch the back as early as possible on this one.
* There are three ways to exit the whip:
  * Standard: 1/2 turn on 5, forward on 6.
  * Inside Turn: bring the left hand up on 4.  Straight back on 5, let go of the back quickly.
  * Outside Turn: bring the left hand up on 4, outside the shoulder.  Use your body to turn.
* One way to help lead connection at the beginning of the dance is to "fake" the last bit of
  an anchor just before 1.  This means, come together slightly, then apart, then back on 1.
