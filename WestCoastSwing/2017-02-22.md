Hareesh and Angela

* Maintain constant rotation during patterns instead of employing
  sharp punctuated rotation - it makes movements look and feel
  more smooth.  For foundation patterns, this means start rotating
  on 2 and end on 4.
* Shoulders.
* Don't get too far out of the slot.
* Step back on 1.  Don't cheat on left side passes.  Even when you
  do cheat (a bit), the connection needs to come straight back.
