Ben and Katie

* The difference between a single and double outside turn after
a whip is turning to square and turning 45 degrees past square.
Also, a double is a floated anchor.  Keep your hand over the follow's
head as she turns and bring your hand down when she is 90 degrees
short of 2 full rotations.

Hareesh and Angela

* Clear the slot.
* Look down the slot during moves.
* Small preps.
* Eye contact when follower is settled (including 4 of whip).
* Eye contact when hitting breaks.
* Make sure you take her with you when grooving in the starter step.
* Rotate left shoulder on 5 of the whip.  Disconnect your arm a bit
and make sure to send the follower down the slot.
