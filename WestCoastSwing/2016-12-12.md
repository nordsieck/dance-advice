* Drag walks:
  * Letting the follow drag is usually easier than dragging the follow.
    Just make sure not to do even the slightest post.
  * Calibrate your connection during drag walks on the level of
    in-flight connection you normally feel.  It can be a bit more, but
    not much.
  * Use eye contact and other visual cues to let the follower know
    they are doing what you intended.
  * Turn failed backward drag walks into sugar pushes - don't try to
    make them into passes.
* Acceleration: it's there to give more control/options in patterns.
  * If you aren't leading a turn, it can be good to accelerate to the
    third beat, as it emphasizes the triples.  If you are leading a
    turn, accelerating to the second beat is usually better because
    it gives more time for steering.
* Keep elbows down and thumbs up and out.
* Keep the arms level.
* Make the connection as clean, quiet and pure as possible.
* Don't pivot on 1 - go straight back.  This is particularly bad if
  your arm is near full extension, because it forces the follow to
  take an extra big step - bigger than was was intended.  Watch for
  this on inside rolls.
