Hareesh

* Engage your core (elongate your torso) and rotate your pelvis forward
  (junk towards partner's nose).  Be tall.
* Don't drop your hand below the point where the follow's arms are level.
  Too high is not great, but too low is a false signal and really bad.
  Instead, bring the arms back to pick up slack.
* Make sure to turn smoothly in rotational movements (e.g. whip).  Don't
  slow down in some parts or speed up when you're taking energy from
  your partner.
* The anchor triple is special - transfer weight on the 1 of the double
  instead of the 2.  This will give you more time to settle.  You also
  don't need to step out the triple, but can instead do a body isolation
  to keep the rhythm.  This can really help on fast songs.
