Hareesh and Angela

* The prep for the inside roll and sugar tuck: step back, panel to the left
  and move the hand to the right.  This will feel a bit awkward and squeeze
  your deltoid if you're doing it right.
* Make sure to be at least at eye height on 2 if you're leading a turn.
* Transfer your weight!  Esp on the 4 of the whip, be at least 80-20 on the
  left leg.
* Don't check step on the 3-and of the whip.
* Be able to turn up and down pulse, not just on-off.
* Don't lead a hitch step (lead the follow to check back) on 1 (unless you
  mean to).  Instead, be a bit under-speed to encourage stretch, and keep
  your connection / wrist quiet otherwise.
* Keep your preps small.  This is most important at high tempos.
* Be able to dance 10 (percent) over.  160 bpm is about as fast as anyone
  will play these days, so being able to dance comfortably at 180 will
  make everything safe.
* Make sure to drive during fast songs, this is especially important if
  you're trying to do blues timing or any other syncopation.  During slow
  music, you can slow to make the syncopation, but you'll get off time if
  you try that to fast songs.
