Hareesh and Angela

* Transition between half time and full time on the anchor.  Give the follow
  time to adjust to ease into the new tempo.
* If you can't do that, do something different from normal - use more control.
  Anything that says "something's coming".
* To transition between drag walks and a sugar push in half time, accelerate
  into the 2 of the sugar push... like normal.
* The better and better you are, the smaller the size of the phrase you can
  accentuate.
* Imagine there is a very long pole running through the center of your chest.
  The pole should be straight on and not touch the ground at all.
* No bounce.  When driving, you have to bend the knees a bit, but don't show
  it.
* Continue to use intention when dancing.
* Fully settle on the "correct" hip.  1 & 2 of a double, 2 of a triple.
* Quiet the heels, especially in the anchor.
* Right foot forward on the anchor.
* Don't open your stance on the anchor (or any other time).  As often as you
  can place your feet directly under you.  This will get you on balance
  faster.
* When stepping in place, completely settle on the foot that's weighted.
