* Follows should have directional intent, always trying to get into either tension of compression.  Be like a car: always in drive.  When you stop, you use the break, don't go into park.
* Connection strength: enough stretch to feel through the connection, but not too much to break.
* Stop / go: In a couple, one person is always generating movement and one person is always resisting the movement.  In tension, the resister is a water skier.  In compression, the person is a refrigerator.
* If you want to move part of your body past your feet, use your hips not your head.
* Resisted release: a technique to maintain connection.  Give your follow resistance while you put her where you want her.  This helps to maintain the connection.
* There doesn't have to be an anchor.  Just make sure that you maintain the connection.  Be like a kite handler: in a strong wind, follow the kite, in a weak wind, back up.  It's important to be a robust dancer, able to handle deviations from perfection.
