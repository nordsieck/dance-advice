Hareesh and Angela

* Posture!  Stand tall.  Shoulders relaxed and back.  Open the collar bones.  Imagine a hook pulling up from the bottome of the sternum.  Walk with a cape.  Posture makes everything work well together.  Don't pinch the shoulders back - everything needs to be relaxed and engaged.
* Step onto straight legs.  Legs should be 90% straight - not locked out, but not visibly flexed.
* Small steps.
* Panneling.  Walk with a slight "natural body" motion.  This will help with leading most moves and make larger steps look better.
* Panneling helps to set up the sugar tuck.  On 3, panel back more than normal (doesn't have to be a huge amount), but don't allow the hand to come back behind the normal square-to-the-slot plane.
* On the left side pass or under arm turn, step back and out of the slot, but lead straight back.  Don't raise your hand until 2.
* On the under arm turn, make sure to raise the arm high enough: face height on 2 and over the head on 3.  The elbow hangs from the hand.  It's best to rotate the hand to maintain connection through compresssion.  After the turn is complete, place the hand down on the outside of the slot.
* The right hand stays down by the hip if you don't want to use it.  If people think you may be leading a sugar push, you're doing it wrong.
* Small steps.  Make sure to completely settle over the hip that has your weigh, every time you change weight.
