* Do full weight transfers on the 1 and 2 of a double and the 2 of a triple.  In
  order to do the triple correctly, you have to commit through the movement so
  that the 1 doesn't feel like a check step.  Test weight transfers by picking up
  your foot and move foot around to full extension (front, side, and back).
* No bounce in west coast swing.  This means the the head and hips should be level
  for the most part.
* Get out of the slot during passes.  Don't lead the passes too close so that
  both dancers have more freedom to improvise.
* Post on 4.  The post is the point you set the anchor.  You may have to move more
  or less depending on how fast the follow is moving.
* Connect with relaxed arms.  Use back muscles and lean away to generate the connection.
  Don't bicep curl the anchor.
* Don't let your frame collapse on the anchor (esp left side).
* For proper frame, stand up straight.  Let shoulders relax and drop, but don't push
  the down.  Don't push out your chest.
* If you double time, it will be unexpected if it starts in the middle of a pattern.

Questions:
* What is the difference between using the arms to anchor and shortening the arms?
