Hareesh and Angela

* Dance tighter, especially to faster songs.
* New move: double outside turn.
  1 Back and to the left (like a whip).
  2 J-hook (like a whip), but bring the hand up to turn height.  You
    should be perpendicular to the slot and facing your partner, offset.
    Your hand should be just to the outside of your partner's shoulder,
    which means she needs to be relatively down the slot, and you can't
    take such big steps that she's far away.
  3 Lead the turn here.  Only takes 1/2 a beat, and then you follow the
    rest of the way.
  4 Make sure to post.  She'll use your post similarly to an inside roll.
  5 Anchor.
  6 Anchor.
