Hareesh and Angela

* When walking forward, the heel comes down before the beat
and the ball comes down just after the beat
* J hooks are a general technique used to control shaping
of the follower during a turn.  The different parts initiate,
continue and stop the rotation.
* Let follows settle before redirection: a mini anchor e.g.
the middle of a whip.
* 3 ways to connect: physical, visual and musical.  Musical
connection is imparting an aesthetic or style to the other
person so they move in a musically consistent way in the
future.  Especially shaping.
